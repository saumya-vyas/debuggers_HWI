## How It Works

### 1. Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)
The system searches through a comprehensive farming knowledge base to find relevant information based on:
- User's selected crop
- Query keywords
- Context of the conversation

### 2. AI Analysis
Using Google's Gemini AI, the system:
- Analyzes farmer data (crop type, seeding date, NDVI, weather, soil)
- Generates structured recommendations
- Provides actionable next steps
- Identifies critical alerts and warnings

### 3. Response Generation
Combines retrieved knowledge with AI analysis to provide:
- Structured, easy-to-understand advice
- Specific recommendations for the farmer's situation
- Weather-based considerations
- Soil health insights
